# Scania Logistics Portal

## The background and problem statement
In an industrial setup, the employees had to access information about different processes, procedures and upcoming tasks available in different tools, different departments and from other stakeholders. All this information was gathered and maintained within large spreadsheets (or excel spreadsheets). The employees faced issues in managing the excel spreadsheets which had a negative impact on their overall work process and decision making. A study was conducted to learn more about their problems and needs. Based on research, an information system (dashboard) was proposed and designed to overcome the problems faced by users. The study also focused on evaluating the overall experience of employees while working with dashboard and excel spreadsheets separately.


> **¨What are the problems encountered by the employees in a complex industrial setting while managing long term projects?  In what ways could a dashboard support and enhance the user experience for the employees managing  these issues?¨**



## My role
- Conducted the research, understanding and revealing the underlying problems of using the excel sheets. 
- Designed an information management system to be used for gathering information about different processes, procedures and upcoming tasks available in different tools, different departments and from other stakeholders.
- I was involved in all three phases of the case study: user study, design proposal and analysis of the dashboard. This included user research, brainstorming, defining the requirements, designing, testing the dashboard, examining the support provided by dashboard to employees in their day-to day work, and evaluating the user experience of working with the dashboard.

## The dashboard
A Portal for helping people manage their work, view their upcoming tasks, track deliveries and their work and explore history of work done any time in past. This project was done for Master Thesis.

## The 3 phase approach

### User study
The goal of the semi-structured interviews was to know more about the tools used by employees, context of use, user goals, tasks, needs and requirements. 

**Participants** - The interviews were conducted separately with five users (P1 - P5), all aged between 30 and 60. The participants consisted of *four men and one woman*. The participants belonged to the same technical background and have similar process for performing the tasks although in a different order.

### Design
The dashboard, was designed using UCD to provide users with all the desired information in one place so they could visualize and retrieve information more efficiently. The system also allowed the users to contact with other stakeholders and departments. The four phases of design were: understand, specify, design and evaluate.

- understand: the focus was mainly on the process followed by the users. The users were asked to explain in detail about their daily tasks and how they are performed.
- specify: based on the research, the problems were narrowed down and the requirements were set.
- design: 
- evaluate:

## The Results
According to the study results, the efficiency of employees can be increased and the decision making can be improved using MIS. With better retrieval techniques user experience was also enhanced. The interactive visualizations of dashboard attracted users and was used efficiently for providing tons of information about procedures to be followed.

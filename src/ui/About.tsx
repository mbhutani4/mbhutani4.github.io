      <Paragraph>
        I am passionate about using UX/UI and IxD to design user-friendly
        products, environments and systems. I use my skills in user research,
        front end development, user testing, prototyping and heuristic
        evaluation to implement our clientâ€™s vision. I love solving problems and
        tackling new challenges. I look to create synergies and cohesion in
        teams to bring out the best performance and exceed expectations.
